# DES431-BD-Project2 Description

This project is a part of the DES431 Big Data Analytics course at SIIT, Thammasat University. 

A total of two projects are uploaded to this repository, both the programs are written in Python. The dataset in both files has passed the EDA with the cleansing process before using the actual techniques required by the course's instructor.

The first project, `BD-Project1.ipynb`, is to utilize dimensional and analysis techniques such as PCA, T-SNE, and UMAP to make an unsupervised learning model and extract information from the dataset, as a result, we received a visualization as scatter plots, done using `matplotlib`. The dataset used is PISA 2018 math scores from Belgium which is available in the code.

The second project, `BD-Project2.ipynb`, is to specifically utilize techniques such as SGD and SVD to make a recommendation system based on the Netflix reviews dataset. The goal of this recommendation system is to create a supervised learning model and use it to predict the missing / not-rated indices.
